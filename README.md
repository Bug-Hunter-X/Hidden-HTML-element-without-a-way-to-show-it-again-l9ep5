This repository demonstrates a common yet easily overlooked bug in HTML:  hiding an element without providing a mechanism to restore its visibility. The `bug.html` file shows the problematic code, where a button click hides a div element using `style.display = "none";`, but lacks a way to reverse this action. The `solution.html` file offers a fix by adding functionality to show the div again.
